# Module 3 Learning Outcomes – Verification Protocol

These outcomes define how learners confirm and act on AI dashboard alerts
without overreacting or ignoring risk.

Module 3 assumes learners already trust alerts and can interpret trends.

---

## After completing Module 3, learners will be able to:

1. Apply a verification protocol to confirm whether a predictive alert represents a real operational issue.
2. Select appropriate verification actions based on alert type, severity, and time-to-failure.
3. Evaluate verification findings to determine whether immediate intervention is required.
4. Distinguish between alerts requiring monitoring, inspection, or escalation.
5. Execute verification steps that align with safety rules and operational constraints.
