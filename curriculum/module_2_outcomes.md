# Module 2 Learning Outcomes – Interpreting Trends

These outcomes define the observable behaviors learners must demonstrate
after completing Module 2.

Module 2 builds directly on Module 1 and does NOT re-teach trust in AI.

## After completing Module 2, learners will be able to:

1. Analyze performance trend data to distinguish normal variation from emerging operational risk.
2. Evaluate predictive alerts in relation to trend direction, magnitude, and rate of change.
3. Determine when a trend requires immediate investigation versus continued monitoring.
4. Prioritize multiple alerts based on potential operational impact and time-to-failure.
5. Justify trend-based decisions using dashboard evidence rather than intuition.

## Bloom’s Level Target

Primary: Analyze, Evaluate  
Secondary: Apply

## Explicit Non-Goals

Module 2 does NOT:
- Explain what AI dashboards are
- Rebuild trust in predictive alerts
- Teach verification procedures (handled in Module 3)
