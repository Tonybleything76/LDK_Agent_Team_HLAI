Scenario: Customer Service Onboarding + De-escalation (v0.5.1 test)

# Business Brief: Customer Service Excellence Training

## Business Context

Our contact center operations are experiencing high turnover (45% annually) and declining customer satisfaction scores (CSAT dropped from 82% to 71% in Q4 2025). Exit interviews reveal that new agents feel overwhelmed during their first 90 days, citing inadequate training on de-escalation techniques and system navigation.

**Organizational Goals:**
- Reduce new-hire attrition from 45% to 30% by Q3 2026
- Improve first-call resolution rate from 68% to 80%
- Increase CSAT scores back to 80%+ within 6 months

**Strategic Priority:** This is a Tier 1 initiative tied to our customer experience transformation roadmap.

## Target Audience

**Primary Learners:** Newly hired customer service representatives (CSRs) in their first 30 days

**Profile:**
- Job Role: Inbound customer service, handling billing inquiries, technical support, and account changes
- Current Skill Level: Entry-level, most have retail or hospitality experience but no contact center background
- Knowledge Gaps: CRM system proficiency, conflict de-escalation, company policies
- Learning Preferences: Prefer hands-on practice over lecture-style content
- Estimated Cohort Size: 40-60 learners per quarter

**Constraints:**
- Learners are on paid training time but need to be productive quickly
- Limited computer literacy for some learners
- English is a second language for approximately 30% of cohort

## Learning Goals

After completing this course, learners should be able to:

1. Navigate the ServiceNow CRM system to access customer accounts, log interactions, and escalate issues appropriately
2. Apply the LEAP de-escalation framework (Listen, Empathize, Apologize, Problem-solve) in challenging customer interactions
3. Identify and execute the correct resolution path for the 15 most common customer inquiries (billing disputes, password resets, service upgrades, etc.)

## Constraints and Requirements

- **Timeline**: Course must be ready for pilot testing by March 15, 2026 (5 weeks from now)
- **Budget**: Limited to existing LMS platform (Articulate Rise) and internal SME time
- **Technology**: Must work on both desktop and tablet (agents use iPads during training)
- **Compliance**: Must include mandatory data privacy and PCI compliance sections (legal requirement)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all digital content

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 95%+ of learners complete within first 30 days of employment
- **Assessment Performance**: 85%+ pass rate on final knowledge check (first attempt)
- **Time-to-Proficiency**: New hires meet productivity targets (15 calls/day, 80% quality score) by day 45 (currently day 60)
- **Business Impact**: Reduce training-related escalations to supervisors by 40%

**Note:** The de-escalation framework is new and not yet documented. We'll need to work with our top-performing agents to codify best practices. The CRM system is scheduled for a major update in April 2026, but we're proceeding with current version for now.
