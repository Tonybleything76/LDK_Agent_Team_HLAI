## 2. Announcement Email — Getting Buy-In

**Subject:** A faster way to start your shift — AI Dashboard Training now available

**From:** [VP of Operations or Plant Director name]

---

Team,

Every shift, you make dozens of decisions that keep production running. Right now, many of those decisions rely on manual reports, verbal handoffs, or walking the floor to piece together what happened overnight.

Starting [Launch Date], you will have access to a short training course — **AI Adoption for Operations Managers** — that shows you how to use the AI production dashboard to get that same information in minutes, not hours.

**What this is:**
- A 45-minute self-paced eLearning course you can complete on your desktop or tablet
- Four short modules with realistic production scenarios — no theory, no coding
- Practical skills you can use on your very next shift

**What this is NOT:**
- A replacement for your judgment or experience
- A course about how AI works under the hood
- Busywork — every minute of this training connects to decisions you already make

**Why this matters:**
The AI dashboard pulls data directly from production line sensors and updates every 5 minutes. It shows you real-time throughput, performance trends, and predictive alerts — information that can help you catch problems before they become downtime.

Managers who have piloted dashboard use report faster shift-start assessments and earlier detection of equipment issues. This training gives everyone the same foundation.

**What to expect:**
- You will receive access to the course on [Launch Date]
- Complete it within 10 days at your own pace — you can pause and resume between tasks
- Your supervisor will hold a brief huddle in the first week to answer questions

This is about giving you better inputs for the decisions you are already making. Your experience on the floor is what makes those decisions good — the dashboard just makes them faster.

## 3. Manager Huddle Guide — Supporting Your Team Through the Change

### Purpose
This guide helps supervisors and plant managers run a brief (10-minute) huddle with their operations managers during the first week after the AI Dashboard Training course launches. The goal is to reinforce key messages, address concerns, and establish expectations.

### When to Use
Hold this huddle during a shift-start meeting within Days +1 to +5 of course launch.

### Huddle Agenda (10 minutes)

**1. Set the Context (2 minutes)**

Say something like:
> "You have or will be completing a short training on using the AI production dashboard. I want to take a few minutes to talk about why this matters and what I expect going forward."

Key points to make:
- This training is a company priority — leadership is investing in it because the data shows dashboards can reduce downtime and speed up decisions
- The dashboard does not replace your judgment — it gives your judgment better data
- Completing the training is expected within 10 days

**2. Address the Elephant in the Room (3 minutes)**

Anticipate and address these common concerns:

| Concern | Suggested Response |
|---------|--------------------|
| "The AI is just guessing" | "The dashboard pulls directly from production line sensors — temperature, vibration, pressure. It is reading real machine data, not making things up. Think of it like a check-engine light — sensor-triggered, not random." |
| "This replaces what I do" | "You still make every decision. The dashboard gives you one more input — a fast one. Your experience is what makes the decision good." |
| "I don't have time for this" | "The course is 45 minutes and you can pause between modules. The skills save time every shift by replacing manual data gathering with a single screen." |
| "We've seen tech rollouts fail before" | "Fair point. That's why we're investing in proper training, not just dropping a new tool on your screen. And I'm here to support you through it." |

**3. Set Expectations (2 minutes)**

Be clear and specific:
- "I expect everyone to complete the course within 10 days"
- "After training, I expect you to check the dashboard at the start of every shift"
- "If an alert appears, I expect you to evaluate it — not ignore it"
- "If you're unsure, that's fine — bring it to me and we'll work through it together"

**4. Open It Up (3 minutes)**

Ask:
- "Has anyone already started the course? What did you think?"
- "What questions do you have about the dashboard or the training?"
- "What would make it easier for you to start using the dashboard this week?"

Listen. Do not dismiss concerns. If you cannot answer a question, say so and follow up.

### After the Huddle
- Note any unresolved questions and escalate to L&D within 24 hours
- Check in individually with any manager who seems resistant — a private conversation is more effective than a group setting
- Lead by example: reference dashboard data in your own shift communications

## 4. Post-Training Nudge — What Happens 2 Weeks Later

### Nudge Strategy: "Your Dashboard Week in Review"

**Timing:** Day +14 (two weeks after course launch)

**Channel:** Email + printed quick-reference card placed at each manager's workstation

### Nudge Email

**Subject:** Your first two weeks with the AI Dashboard — a quick check-in

---

Hi [First Name],

You completed AI Dashboard Training two weeks ago. Here is a quick check-in to keep the momentum going.

**Quick Self-Check — Honest Answers Only:**

- [ ] I have checked the AI dashboard at the start of at least one shift this week
- [ ] I have read a predictive alert and identified its prediction, basis, and action window
- [ ] I have made or adjusted a production decision using dashboard data
- [ ] I have documented a dashboard-informed decision in my shift notes

If you checked all four — you are building the habit. Keep going.

If you missed some — that is normal. Pick one item from the list and do it on your next shift. Start with just checking the dashboard at shift start.

**One Thing to Try This Week:**

At the start of your next shift, before you do anything else, open the dashboard and answer these three questions:
1. What is the throughput status of each line? (Green / Yellow / Red)
2. Are there any predictive alerts? If so, what is the action window?
3. Based on what you see, is there anything you need to act on in the first hour?

This takes under 2 minutes. That is the habit.

**Need a refresher?**
The course is still available in the LMS. Module 1 (10 minutes) and the four-step workflow summary in Module 4 are the most useful for a quick review.

Your experience runs the floor. The dashboard just gets you there faster.

### Printed Quick-Reference Card

**Title:** AI Dashboard — Shift-Start Quick Reference

**Format:** Laminated card (A5 or half-letter), placed at each manager's workstation

**Content:**

| Step | Action | What to Look For |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1. Consult | Open the AI dashboard | All line statuses visible |
| 2. Interpret | Check throughput indicators | Green = on target, Yellow = watch, Red = below target |
| | Check predictive alerts | Prediction + basis + action window |
| | Check performance trends | Stable, improving, or declining |
| 3. Decide | Evaluate against your context | Act, Modify, or Escalate |
| 4. Document | Record in shift notes | Alert details + decision + rationale |

**Bottom of card:** "Sensor data, not guesses. Updated every 5 minutes. Your judgment, better informed."

## 7. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Veteran managers dismiss training as unnecessary | Huddle Guide specifically addresses this; frame dashboard as augmenting — not replacing — experience; supervisor one-on-one follow-up for persistent resistance |
| Managers complete training but do not change behavior | Post-training nudge + quick-reference card + Day +30 usage review + supervisor expectation-setting in huddle |
| Supervisors do not hold huddles | Pre-brief supervisors on huddle importance; L&D follows up at Day +7 to confirm huddles occurred |
| Low completion rates | Day +7 reminder; supervisor accountability; leadership visibility into completion data |
| Dashboard access barriers (device issues, login problems) | Pre-launch IT check; include tech support contact in announcement email and reminder |
