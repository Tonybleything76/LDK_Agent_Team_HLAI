## LMS Course Description

This 45-minute self-paced eLearning course equips plant operations managers to confidently use AI dashboards for daily production decisions. Through four short modules and realistic scenario-based exercises, learners will understand what the AI dashboard displays and where its data originates, identify and differentiate performance trends, predictive alerts, and throughput indicators, interpret predictive alerts accurately, and apply a structured decision workflow — consult, interpret, decide, document — to take timely, data-driven action on the production floor. No prior AI knowledge is required. The course is optimized for desktop and tablet access and designed for completion across shifts.

## Open Items for Resolution Before Build

1. Validate 'throughput indicator' terminology with SME — term is used extensively but not in SME-provided terminology list
2. Define capstone scoring rubric — point allocation across S1–S4 and partial credit rules
3. Confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirement and specify colorblind-safe alternatives
4. Specify tablet performance budget for complex animations
5. Confirm whether progress saving / bookmarking is a build requirement
6. Determine whether a post-training job aid (downloadable quick-reference card) is in scope for LMS delivery
