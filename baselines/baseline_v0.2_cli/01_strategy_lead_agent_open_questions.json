  "What specific AI dashboard platform or tool are the managers expected to use? (Needed for realistic screenshots and scenario fidelity)",
  "Are there quantitative baseline metrics available for current dashboard usage rates, average decision-making time, or production inefficiency rates? (Needed to set measurable post-training targets)",
  "Are there additional real-world scenarios beyond the machine-failure throughput example that should be included? (Needed for scenario variety in assessment design)",
  "Is there an existing onboarding or standard operating procedure that this training should integrate with or reference?",
  "Will managers have access to the AI dashboard during the training (live environment or sandbox), or will the course use simulated/static dashboard representations?",
  "Who are the key stakeholders for sign-off on this learning strategy (e.g., plant director, L&D lead, IT)?",
  "Are there any accessibility requirements beyond responsive desktop/tablet design (e.g., WCAG compliance level, language localization)?"
