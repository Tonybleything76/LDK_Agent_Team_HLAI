  "What specific AI dashboard platform or product are the managers using? Visual fidelity in scenarios depends on this.",
  "Are there existing performance data or usage logs showing current dashboard adoption rates to establish a baseline?",
  "Have managers experienced previous failed technology rollouts that may contribute to change fatigue?",
  "Is there management or supervisory reinforcement planned post-training (e.g., shift leads checking dashboard usage)?",
  "What is the typical shift length and break structure, to optimize module completion windows?",
  "Are there any accessibility requirements (e.g., color vision deficiency considerations for dashboard simulations)?",
  "Will learners complete training during paid work time or on their own time? This significantly affects motivation and completion rates."
