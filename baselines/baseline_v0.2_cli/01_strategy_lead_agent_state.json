(Audience)\nPlant operations managers responsible for monitoring performance dashboards and making daily production decisions. Most have limited experience using AI tools.\n\n## What is the performance problem?\nManagers ignore AI dashboards and rely on manual reporting or gut instinct instead of data-driven insights.\n\n## What does success look like?\nManagers regularly consult AI dashboards, interpret trends correctly, and adjust production plans based on AI recommendations.\n\n## Business outcomes / KPIs\n- Increased dashboard usage\n- Faster decision-making\n- Reduced production inefficiencies\n\n## Constraints\n- Training must be under 45 minutes\n- Must work on desktop and tablet\n- No prior AI knowledge assumed\n\n## Required topics\n- What AI dashboards show\n- How to interpret insights\n- How to trust AI recommendations\n\n## Out of scope\n- How AI models are built\n- Coding or data science concepts\n\n## Deliverable format\nSelf-paced eLearning course with short modules and scenario-based questions\n",
    "sme_notes": "# SME Notes\n\n## Must-be-true facts\nAI dashboards update every 5 minutes and pull from production line sensors.\n\n## Terminology\nAI dashboard, predictive alert, performance trend.\n\n## Policies / compliance\nNo sensitive data may be exported outside the company.\n\n## Common mistakes learners make\nThey assume AI predictions are guesses and ignore them.\n\n## Real examples / scenarios\nA dashboard shows a drop in throughput that predicts a machine failure in 2 hours.\n"
