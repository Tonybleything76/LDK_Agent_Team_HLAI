### Option B: Manual Release Creation

If you prefer to create the release manually:

1. **Merge this PR** to the main branch (optional but recommended for documentation)

## Why This Approach?

The automated workflow provides several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Standardizes the release process
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces manual steps and potential errors
3. **Documentation**: Release notes are version-controlled
4. **Repeatability**: Easy to create future releases
5. **Flexibility**: Supports both automatic and manual triggers

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails to trigger:

1. **Verify workflow is active**:
   ```bash
   # Check if workflow appears in the Actions tab
   # It should appear after merging to main
   ```

2. **Check workflow permissions**:
   - Repository Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled

3. **Manual fallback**:
   - Use Option B above to create the release manually
   - The process takes only a few minutes

## Future Releases

For future releases, simply:

1. Create release notes in `docs/release_notes_<tag>.md`
2. Update VERSION file if needed
3. Create and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.5.3 -m "Release message"
   git push origin v0.5.3
   ```
4. The workflow will automatically create the GitHub release!
