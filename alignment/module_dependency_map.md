# Module Dependency Map – MVP Lite

This document defines what each module assumes the learner already knows or can do
before entering that module. This prevents repetition and gaps.

---

## Module 1 (Baseline – already completed)

Learners can:
- Explain what an AI dashboard is used for
- Explain why predictive alerts are not guesses
- Recognize the cost of ignoring an alert
- Distinguish current status from a trend
- Decide to investigate an alert instead of ignoring it

---

## Module 2 – Interpreting Trends

Module 2 assumes the learner can already:
- Trust that AI alerts are evidence-based
- Recognize the difference between status and trend
- Take an alert seriously enough to investigate

Module 2 does NOT need to:
- Rebuild trust in AI
- Explain where data comes from
- Re-teach what an alert is

---

## Module 3 – Verification Protocol

Module 3 assumes the learner can already:
- Recognize when an alert matters
- Understand that alerts come before failure
- Want to avoid unplanned downtime

Module 3 does NOT need to:
- Convince learners that AI is useful
- Explain dashboard basics again

---

## Module 4 – End-to-End Decision Practice

Module 4 assumes the learner can already:
- Consult the dashboard proactively
- Interpret alerts and trends
- Apply a verification step before acting

Module 4 does NOT need to:
- Teach definitions
- Explain AI credibility
- Reintroduce scenarios from Module 1
